# Picasa

A simple flutter application to display an infinite grid of images from an API.
This application also allows users to share and download images, in addition to opening the source URL in device's default browser.

- Application displays a grid view of images fetched from an API.
- Grid view has pull to refresh functionality and loads 10 images per request, loading additional images as user continues to scroll.
- A long press on image item will show three icons (left-to-right: Open source url in external browser, Download image, Share image)
- Application also detects when user is disconnected from internet and displays a no-internet widget. There is an internet availability check before the API call, failing which it will show the no-internet widget with a retry button. (For instances the users has connectivity but no data). The retry button will be hidden once internet is back, only for the time when there is no images loaded at all.
- The top-right corner has a button with a menu to change application theme. Light, dark or system settings.
- Just for now, image with id will by default show error, to demonstrate error widget. (open url will work, download and share will display an error message.)

## Packages

- google_fonts: ^6.2.1 -> to enable using google fonts without storing them locally. (For now fonts will be loaded only when connected to internet, there is a workaround to make them run offline as well.)
- provider: ^6.1.2 -> for state management throughout the application.
- shared_preferences: ^2.2.3 -> for saving some data in device's memory like selected theme or any other.
- http: ^1.2.1 -> to make API calls.
- cached_network_image: ^3.3.1 -> to show network images with cache support, with facility to show custom widget on error or as a placeholder.
- connectivity_plus: ^5.0.2 -> to check whether device is connected to wifi/mobile data or not. (The package does not really state whether there is internet or not, so for workaround we have our own internet pinging logic along with it, to avoid making API call when no internet.)
- fluttertoast: ^8.2.5 -> to display context free toast message ðŸ˜….
- url_launcher: ^6.3.0 -> to open url to an external browser.
- path_provider: ^2.1.3 -> to be able to get a manage path directory.

- share_plus: ^9.0.0 -> to be able to share image.
- open_file: ^3.3.2 -> to be able to open file when downloading is done, so user does not have to look it up in folder.
- image_gallery_saver: ^2.0.3 -> to refresh gallery/photo/file manager after download.

  - infinite_scroll_grid_view -> to show grid of images with pull to refresh and load more.
  - network_child -> to wrap any child with no-internet widget.

- state -> All the state related code.
  - common_provider -> handles common state variables like download and share which will notify to show indicator during process.

  - pic_image_provider -> handles variables for pagination and list of images with their data.
  - theme_provider -> handles variable for selected app theme. (could be light/dark/system).
- utils -> Any common function/method that can be used anywhere in the app.
  - common_utils -> contains methods for checking internet availability, download logic, share logic.
